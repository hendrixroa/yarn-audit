Additionally, in order to prevent unnecessary stat calls to determine whether a given path is a directory, paths are cached when directories are created.\n\nThis logic was insufficient when extracting tar files that contained both a directory and a symlink with the same name as the directory, where the symlink and directory names in the archive entry used backslashes as a path separator on posix systems. The cache checking logic used both `\\` and `/` characters as path separators, however `\\` is a valid filename character on posix systems.\n\nBy first creating a directory, and then replacing that directory with a symlink, it was thus possible to bypass node-tar symlink checks on directories, essentially allowing an untrusted tar file to symlink into an arbitrary location and subsequently extracting arbitrary files into that location, thus allowing arbitrary file creation and overwrite.\n\nAdditionally, a similar confusion could arise on case-insensitive filesystems.  If a tar archive contained a directory at `FOO`, followed by a symbolic link named `foo`, then on case-insensitive file systems, the creation of the symbolic link would remove the directory from the filesystem, but _not_ from the internal directory cache, as it would not be treated as a cache hit.

This _may_ result in undue cache misses on case-sensitive file systems, but the performance impact is negligible.\n\n#### Caveat\n\nNote that this means that the `entry` objects exposed in various parts of tar's API will now always use `/` as a path separator, even on Windows systems.  This is not expected to cause problems, as `/` is a valid path separator on Windows systems, but _may_ result in issues if `entry.path` is compared against a path string coming from some other API such as `fs.realpath()` or `path.resolve()`.\n\nUsers are encouraged to always normalize paths using a well-tested method such as `path.resolve()` before comparing paths to one another.","url":"https://github.com/advisories/GHSA-9r2w-394v-53qc"}}}

This enables robust demonstration capabilities on sites like `petstore.swagger.io`, `editor.swagger.io`, and similar sites, where users often want to see what their OpenAPI definitions would look like rendered.\n\nHowever, this functionality may pose a risk for users who host their own SwaggerUI instances. In particular, including remote OpenAPI definitions opens a vector for phishing attacks by abusing the trusted names/domains of self-hosted instances.\n\nAn example scenario abusing this functionality could take the following form:\n- `https://example.com/api-docs` hosts a version of SwaggerUI with `?url=` query parameter enabled.\n- Users will trust the domain `https://example.com` and the contents of the OpenAPI definition.\n- A malicious actor may craft a similar OpenAPI definition and service that responds to the defined APIs at `https://evildomain`.\n- Users mistakenly click a phishing URL like `https://example.com/api-docs?url=https://evildomain/fakeapi.yaml` and enters sensitive data via the \"Try-it-out\" feature.\n\nWe do want to stress that this attack vector is limited to scenarios that actively trick users into divulging sensitive information. The ease of this is highly contextual and, therefore, the threat model may be different for individual users and organizations. It is *not* possible to perform non-interactive attacks (e.g., cross-site scripting or code injection) through this mechanism.\n\n### Resolution \nWe've made the decision to [disable query parameters (#4872)](https://github.com/swagger-api/swagger-ui/issues/4872) by default starting with SwaggerUI version `4.1.3`. Please update to this version when it becomes available (**ETA: 2021 December**). Users will still be able to be re-enable the options at their discretion. We'll continue to enable query parameters on the Swagger demo sites.\n\n### Workaround\nIf you host a version of SwaggerUI and wish to mitigate this issue immediately, you are encouraged to add the following custom plugin code:\n\n```js\nSwaggerUI({\n  //  ...other configuration options,\n  plugins: [function UrlParamDisablePlugin() {\n    return {\n      statePlugins: {\n        spec: {\n          wrapActions: {\n            // Remove the ?url parameter from loading an external OpenAPI definition.\n            updateUrl: (oriAction) => (payload) => {\n              const url = new URL(window.location.href)\n              if (url.searchParams.has('url')) {\n                url.searchParams.delete('url')\n                window.location.replace(url.toString())\n              }\n              return oriAction(payload)\n            }\n          }\n        }\n      }\n    }\n  }],\n})\n```\n\n### Future UX work\n\nThrough the exploration of this issue, it became apparent that users may not be aware to which web server the Try-it-out function will send requests. While this information is currently presented at the top of the page, understanding may improve by displaying it closer to the \"Execute\" button where requests are actually made. We'll be exploring these UX improvements over the coming months and welcome community input. Please create a Feature Request under the GitHub Issue tab to start a conversation with us and the community.\n\n## Reflected XSS attack\n\n \n\n**Warning** in versions <= 3.36.2, it is possible to combine the URL options (as mentioned above) with a vunerability in DOMPurify (https://www.cvedetails.com/cve/CVE-2020-26870/) to create a reflected XSS vector.

An attacker can then cause a program using a Regular Expression to enter these extreme situations and then hang for a very long time.\n\nIf are you are using Highlight.js to highlight user-provided data you are possibly vulnerable.  On the client-side (in a browser or Electron environment) risks could include lengthy freezes or crashes... On the server-side infinite freezes could occur... effectively preventing users from accessing your app or service (ie, Denial of Service).\n\nThis is an issue with grammars shipped with the parser (and potentially 3rd party grammars also), not the parser itself. If you are using Highlight.js with any of the following grammars you are vulnerable.  If you are using `highlightAuto` to detect the language (and have any of these grammars registered) you are vulnerable. Exponential grammars (C, Perl, JavaScript) are auto-registered when using the common grammar subset/library `require('highlight.js/lib/common')` as of 10.4.0 - see https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/gh/highlightjs/cdn-release@10.4.0/build/highlight.js\n\nAll versions prior to 10.4.1 are vulnerable, including version 9.18.5. \n\n**Grammars with exponential backtracking issues:**\n\n  - c-like (c, cpp, arduino)\n  - handlebars (htmlbars)\n  - gams\n  - perl\n  - jboss-cli\n  - r\n  - erlang-repl\n  - powershell\n  - routeros\n  - livescript (10.4.0 and 9.18.5 included this fix)\n  - javascript & typescript (10.4.0 included partial fixes)\n\nAnd of course any aliases of those languages have the same issue. ie: `hpp` is no safer than `cpp`.\n\n**Grammars with polynomial backtracking issues:**\n\n- kotlin\n- gcode\n- d\n- aspectj\n- moonscript\n- coffeescript/livescript\n- csharp\n- scilab\n- crystal\n- elixir\n- basic\n- ebnf\n- ruby\n- fortran/irpf90\n- livecodeserver\n- yaml\n- x86asm\n- dsconfig\n- markdown\n- ruleslanguage\n- xquery\n- sqf\n\nAnd again: any aliases of those languages have the same issue. ie: `ruby` and `rb` share the same ruby issues.\n\n\n### Patches\n\n- Version 10.4.1 resolves these vulnerabilities.  Please upgrade.\n\n### Workarounds / Mitigations\n\n- Discontinue use the affected grammars. (or perhaps use only those with poly vs exponential issues)\n- Attempt cherry-picking the grammar fixes into older versions...\n- Attempt using newer CDN versions of any affected languages.  (ie using an older CDN version of the library with newer CDN grammars).

This is, in part, achieved by ensuring that extracted directories are not symlinks.  Additionally, in order to prevent unnecessary `stat` calls to determine whether a given path is a directory, paths are cached when directories are created.\n\nThis logic was insufficient when extracting tar files that contained both a directory and a symlink with the same name as the directory. This order of operations resulted in the directory being created and added to the `node-tar` directory cache. When a directory is present in the directory cache, subsequent calls to mkdir for that directory are skipped. However, this is also where `node-tar` checks for symlinks occur.\n\nBy first creating a directory, and then replacing that directory with a symlink, it was thus possible to bypass `node-tar` symlink checks on directories, essentially allowing an untrusted tar file to symlink into an arbitrary location and subsequently extracting arbitrary files into that location, thus allowing arbitrary file creation and overwrite.\n\nThis issue was addressed in releases 3.2.3, 4.4.15, 5.0.7 and 6.1.2.\n\n### Patches\n\n3.2.3 || 4.4.15 || 5.0.7 || 6.1.2\n\n### Workarounds\n\nUsers may work around this vulnerability without upgrading by creating a custom `filter` method which prevents the extraction of symbolic links.\n\n```js\nconst tar = require('tar')\n\ntar.x({\n  file: 'archive.tgz',\n  filter: (file, entry) => {\n    if (entry.type === 'SymbolicLink') {\n      return false\n    } else {\n      return true\n    }\n  }\n})\n```\n\nUsers are encouraged to upgrade to the latest patch versions, rather than attempt to sanitize tar input themselves.","url":"https://github.com/advisories/GHSA-r628-mhmh-qjhw"}}}

Please update to this version when it becomes available (**ETA: 2021 December**). Users will still be able to be re-enable the options at their discretion. We'll continue to enable query parameters on the Swagger demo sites.\n\n### Workaround\nIf you host a version of SwaggerUI and wish to mitigate this issue immediately, you are encouraged to add the following custom plugin code:\n\n```js\nSwaggerUI({\n  //  ...other configuration options,\n  plugins: [function UrlParamDisablePlugin() {\n    return {\n      statePlugins: {\n        spec: {\n          wrapActions: {\n            // Remove the ?url parameter from loading an external OpenAPI definition.\n            updateUrl: (oriAction) => (payload) => {\n              const url = new URL(window.location.href)\n              if (url.searchParams.has('url')) {\n                url.searchParams.delete('url')\n                window.location.replace(url.toString())\n              }\n              return oriAction(payload)\n            }\n          }\n        }\n      }\n    }\n  }],\n})\n```\n\n### Future UX work\n\nThrough the exploration of this issue, it became apparent that users may not be aware to which web server the Try-it-out function will send requests. While this information is currently presented at the top of the page, understanding may improve by displaying it closer to the \"Execute\" button where requests are actually made. We'll be exploring these UX improvements over the coming months and welcome community input.

We'll continue to enable query parameters on the Swagger demo sites.\n\n### Workaround\nIf you host a version of SwaggerUI and wish to mitigate this issue immediately, you are encouraged to add the following custom plugin code:\n\n```js\nSwaggerUI({\n  //  ...other configuration options,\n  plugins: [function UrlParamDisablePlugin() {\n    return {\n      statePlugins: {\n        spec: {\n          wrapActions: {\n            // Remove the ?url parameter from loading an external OpenAPI definition.\n            updateUrl: (oriAction) => (payload) => {\n              const url = new URL(window.location.href)\n              if (url.searchParams.has('url')) {\n                url.searchParams.delete('url')\n                window.location.replace(url.toString())\n              }\n              return oriAction(payload)\n            }\n          }\n        }\n      }\n    }\n  }],\n})\n```\n\n### Future UX work\n\nThrough the exploration of this issue, it became apparent that users may not be aware to which web server the Try-it-out function will send requests. While this information is currently presented at the top of the page, understanding may improve by displaying it closer to the \"Execute\" button where requests are actually made. We'll be exploring these UX improvements over the coming months and welcome community input. Please create a Feature Request under the GitHub Issue tab to start a conversation with us and the community.\n\n## Reflected XSS attack\n\n \n\n**Warning** in versions <= 3.36.2, it is possible to combine the URL options (as mentioned above) with a vunerability in DOMPurify (https://www.cvedetails.com/cve/CVE-2020-26870/) to create a reflected XSS vector. If your version of Swagger UI is older than or equal to 3.36.2, we suggest you upgrade or implement the workaround as mentioned above.\n","url":"https://github.com/advisories/GHSA-qrmm-w75w-3wpx"}}}

An attacker can then cause a program using a Regular Expression to enter these extreme situations and then hang for a very long time.\n\nIf are you are using Highlight.js to highlight user-provided data you are possibly vulnerable.  On the client-side (in a browser or Electron environment) risks could include lengthy freezes or crashes... On the server-side infinite freezes could occur... effectively preventing users from accessing your app or service (ie, Denial of Service).\n\nThis is an issue with grammars shipped with the parser (and potentially 3rd party grammars also), not the parser itself. If you are using Highlight.js with any of the following grammars you are vulnerable.  If you are using `highlightAuto` to detect the language (and have any of these grammars registered) you are vulnerable. Exponential grammars (C, Perl, JavaScript) are auto-registered when using the common grammar subset/library `require('highlight.js/lib/common')` as of 10.4.0 - see https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/gh/highlightjs/cdn-release@10.4.0/build/highlight.js\n\nAll versions prior to 10.4.1 are vulnerable, including version 9.18.5. \n\n**Grammars with exponential backtracking issues:**\n\n  - c-like (c, cpp, arduino)\n  - handlebars (htmlbars)\n  - gams\n  - perl\n  - jboss-cli\n  - r\n  - erlang-repl\n  - powershell\n  - routeros\n  - livescript (10.4.0 and 9.18.5 included this fix)\n  - javascript & typescript (10.4.0 included partial fixes)\n\nAnd of course any aliases of those languages have the same issue. ie: `hpp` is no safer than `cpp`.\n\n**Grammars with polynomial backtracking issues:**\n\n- kotlin\n- gcode\n- d\n- aspectj\n- moonscript\n- coffeescript/livescript\n- csharp\n- scilab\n- crystal\n- elixir\n- basic\n- ebnf\n- ruby\n- fortran/irpf90\n- livecodeserver\n- yaml\n- x86asm\n- dsconfig\n- markdown\n- ruleslanguage\n- xquery\n- sqf\n\nAnd again: any aliases of those languages have the same issue. ie: `ruby` and `rb` share the same ruby issues.\n\n\n### Patches\n\n- Version 10.4.1 resolves these vulnerabilities.  Please upgrade.\n\n### Workarounds / Mitigations\n\n- Discontinue use the affected grammars. (or perhaps use only those with poly vs exponential issues)\n- Attempt cherry-picking the grammar fixes into older versions...\n- Attempt using newer CDN versions of any affected languages.
